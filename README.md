## TDD testing implemented:

_Describe countToValue():_

>Test: "It should accept a positive numerical value and return all the numbers between 0 and the input number."  
Code: countToValue(5);  
Expected Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 

>Test: "It should accept negative values and count down all the numbers between 0 and the negative input."  
Code: countToValue(-3);  
Expected Output: [-3, -2, -1, 0] 

>Test: "It should return 0 if 0 is the input value."  
Code: countToValue(0);  
Expected Output: [0]

>Test: "It should return a boolean of false if the input is NaN."  
Code: countToValue("dog");  
Expected Output: false

>Test: "It should return a boolean of false if the input is empty."  
Code: countToValue();  
Expected Output: false

_Describe: robogerIt()_

>Test: "It should accept input of a number and return a string."  
Code: robogerIt(5);  
Expected Output: "5" 

>Test: "It should accept input of a number and change any string object including "3" with "Won't you be my neighbor?"  
Code: robogerIt(13);  
Expected Output: "Won't you be my neighbor?" 

>Test: "It should accept input of a number and change any string object including "2" with "Boop."  
Code: robogerIt(211);  
Expected Output: "Boop"  

>Test: "It should accept input of a number and change any string object including "1" with "Beep."  
Code: robogerIt(10);  
Expected Output: "Beep"  

>Test: "It should accept input of an array and return any string object not including "1," "2," "3," as the original number value of the object."  
Code:   
let arrayOfNum = [5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13];  
arrayOfNum.map(robogerIt);  
Expected Output: [5, 6, 7, "Beep", "Boop", "Won't you be my neighbor?"]
